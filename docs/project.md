## üèóÔ∏è Strategic Philosophy

### **Expected Value Over Binary Classification**

We've fundamentally shifted from binary "win/lose" thinking to **probabilistic expected value optimization**. Our system:

1. **Predicts probability distributions** of future price movements
2. **Calculates expected value** including spread costs and execution realities
3. **Optimizes for positive EV** rather than just win rate
4. **Embraces imbalanced data** as natural characteristic of good signals

### **Key Strategic Pillars**

1. **Probabilistic Modeling**: Predict outcome distributions, not binary outcomes
2. **Specialist Model Ensemble**: 12 models specialized for different market regimes
3. **Realistic Execution Modeling**: MT5-identical simulation with dynamic spread
4. **Imbalanced Data Embrace**: Good signals are anomalies, not balanced data
5. **Live Trading Readiness**: Every component validated for real-world deployment

2. **Naive Labeling**: Future price movement without spread consideration
3. **Weak Base Models**: Generic models without specialization
4. **Oversimplified Edge Scoring**: Basic probability √ó reward calculations
5. **No Spread Integration**: Ignoring execution costs in backtesting

### **New Design Principles**
1. **Probabilistic Modeling**: Predict distributions, not binary outcomes
2. **Expected Value Optimization**: Include all costs in calculations
3. **Specialist Models**: Regime-aware model specialization
4. **Realistic Simulation**: MT5-identical execution modeling
5. **Imbalanced Data Embrace**: Good signals are naturally rare
